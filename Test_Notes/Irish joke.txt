Three Englishmen were in a bar and spotted an Irishman.
So, one of the Englishmen walked over to the Irishman, tapped him on the shoulder, and said:
- “Hey, I hear your St. Patrick was a drunken loser.”
- “Oh really, hmm, didn’t know that.”
Puzzled, the Englishman walked back to his buddies.
- “I told him St. Patrick was a loser, and he didn’t care.”
The second Englishman remarked, “You just don’t know how to set him off… watch and learn.”
So, the second Englishman walked over to the Irishman, tapped him on the shoulder and said:
- “Hey, I hear your St. Patrick was lying, cheating, idiotic, low-life scum!”
- “Oh really, hmm, didn’t know that.”
Shocked beyond belief, the Englishman went back to his buddies.
- “You re right. He’s unshakable!”
The third Englishman remarked:
- “Boys, I ll really tick him off… just watch.”
So the third Englishman walked over to the Irishman, tapped him on the shoulder and said:
- “I hear St. Patrick was an Englishman!”
- “Yeah, that’s what your buddies were trying to tell me.”
